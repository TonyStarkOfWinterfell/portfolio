# Reskin collab class

-This isn't a new game but instead a collaboration project between the games-making-class and the digital-arts-class, where we were assigned a partner from the other class and got to put into practice what it's like working with other departments, requesting assets, overly specifying details and bouncing ideas back and fourth on how to improve the project further.
