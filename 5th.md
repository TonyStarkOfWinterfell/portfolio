# FMP / Pawsitively Purrfect

-This is it...the final major project. Possibly my biggest and most ambitious project out of all of my games and my joint favourite (alongside infinity war). I had inspiration from a 'merger' indie game and...who doesn't love cats? 
<br>
Fun fact: This game was only made possible thanks to the help of my digital art partner from the reskin project, as by asking for a favour, they were kind enough to make the cat sprites for me because finding anything close to what I wanted, ESPECIALLY being copyright free, would be near impossible to find online given how specific the premise is.
<br>
This was fun to make as almost everyone in my class enjoyed the conecpt and looked forward to the final result. After completing the game, I sent a copy to the digital arts student and thanked them, only to get a reply not long after, where they mentioned showing it off to their own class and it recieving possitive feedback there too.
